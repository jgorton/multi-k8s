this multi-container app has now been refactored to a deployment via kubernetes, not docker

can make changes here if you want to redeploy/test something.

19/7/23:
	manually downsized GKE cluster size to 0, to minimize/avoid billing.
	the site is still being served, but nothing can be computed.
	checking if a redeploy would still pass the build tests and take effect.

	seems like the pages are using caching or something, updates don't seem to take effect.
	but the page is still visible. interestingly, inside my vm the "cached" version
	is older than the one i can access on my host machine.

	i upped the cluster to have 1 node, and the sites still did not update. then
	i put it back to 3 and it began to work as it did originally. indexes seen was
	recovered but calculated values was reset to empty.
