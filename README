this multi-container app has now been refactored to a deployment via kubernetes, not docker

can make changes here if you want to redeploy/test something.

19/7/23:
	manually downsized GKE cluster size to 0, to minimize/avoid billing.
	the site is still being served, but nothing can be computed.
	checking if a redeploy would still pass the build tests and take effect.
